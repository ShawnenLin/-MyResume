The application filters and responds on click to the list of movies in React below. Let's describe some aspects of this React application by the input-process-output model:

Input:

The program does not take any kind of user input.
Process:

Predefined movie data gets loaded with title, genre, and release year.
It controls the selected genre state based on user interactions with the dropdown menu.
It filters the application according to the genre that the user selected. If the selected is "All Genres," the app would then show all movies.
It handles the click of a user on movie titles.
Output:

It shows a movie list application that includes title, genre, and release year. Filter the movies by genre using the drop-down menu. Clicking a movie title triggers an alert message displaying the clicked movie's title.
